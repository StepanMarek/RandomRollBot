# RandomRollBot

## A simple discord bot to roll dice

### Installation

In order to run the bot, download the code and the required python module **discord.py**. Then, create a script that starts the bot - a python script that creates the object and connects the bot to the server (see the `run_example.py` file). Then, run this script. The script can run in the background.

Note that this is in the early phase of the project - the bot does not output any error messages, and the output is very basic.
